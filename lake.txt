Lake: The Founding of Saskatoon (?) written by Jack Fotheringham and Mitch
Cassidy

List of Characters with Speaking Roles:

{ Mitch }
John Lake (JOHN): A bachelor and part-time farmer in his mid-thirties, notorious
as a drunk and moocher at the Toronto Temperance Society. Perpetually tipsy,
self-aggrandizing, fond of scheming, short-tempered, childish, and strangely
endearing.

{ Jack }
Ike Nutana (IKE): Upstanding citizen, loving husband, and president of the
Toronto Temperance Society. At first glance he is a boring and reasonable man,
while perhaps a bit of a snob. A more vindictive and childish edge shows itself
as his conflicts with John Lake intensify.

{ Emily Migchaels }
Eileen Nutana (EILEEN): Ike Nutana's steadfast and often neglected wife. She is
a fervent prohibitionist and moralist, but perhaps too quick to compromise her
values in service of making prairie life less boring.

{ Lee }
Barrabus Riversdale (BARRY): Better known as 'Blind Barry', he is the most
colourful of the Saskatoon colonists. An elderly man who at least claims to be
blind, he is a prolific drunk with insane tendencies and a questionable memory.
May also be able to see the future.

{ Emily Klatt }
John G. Diefenbaker (DIEF): A perfectly innocent (and seemingly parentless)
12-year-old boy who is a settler in the Nutana colony. He has a great admiration
for John Lake, and no idea that he will grow up to be Canada's 13th Prime
Minister. 

{ Sophie }
Judith Sutherland (JUDITH): The Vice-President of the Toronto Temperance
Society. A highly critical and motivated person who envies Ike Nutana's
leadership and believes they could do a much better job.

{ Paige }
John C. Drinkle (DRINKLE): Saskatoon's wealthiest businessman, as well as its
only sane or sober citizen. He presents the voice of reason in Saskatoon's
development, and is fittingly despised and mistreated by John Lake.

{ Michael }
Wilfrid Laurier (WILF): Canada's 7th Prime Minister and legendary statesman,
portrayed as parody of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

SCENE 1: BARRY is seated in a rocking chair, stage right, under a single
spotlight. A blanket covers his legs and a bottle of liquor fills his hand. He
appears old and senile.

BARRY: (swigs whisky, then is startled to notice the audience) Bgh! (puts on
glasses) I didn't see you folks there! Now where are y'all from? (pauses)
Saskatoon { Saa-ska-toooooon }? Why dagnabbit, I know that town! Matter of fact, I was the one that
founded it. Well, maybe that's a bit of a stretch. But I was there! That's for
damned sure! (chuckles, swigs whisky again) { Say, } You folks ever been to Riversdale?
Well I'll have you know, that little piece { slice? } of heaven is named after yours truly:
Blind Barrabus Riversdale! Yessir { ee }, Barrabus Riversdale is a name that used to
command a great deal of respect around these parts. Course, back in those days,
most folks just called me Blind Barry! And that was just fine by me. (laughs,
swigs again, has a long wheezing cough and then smacks chest to settle it down) 
--
Now, if you really want to know how this fine city was founded, you'll
find no truer _witness_ than old Blind Barry! It's a story of intrigue, { Words
spoken as onamatapeisasasdasda of themselves }
inauguration, intoxication, and more recently, incontinence... at least, that's
what the { damn doctors spreading their lies again } doctor says. 
But most of all, it's the story of a man by the name of
_John_ _Lake_. A man of great character, a tender soul, and a noggin' chock full of
big ideas - { reminiscing } you know, he was a close personal friend of mine. 
Sad truth is, old John Lake's been dead for some 90 years now? So it's just old Blind Barry here
left to tell his story. (swigs, more solemnly now). { Oh yeah? } You folks want to know how
it goes? Well sheesh, alrighty then! (settles in to tell story) Now, if I
remember correctly, it all started at a meeting of the Toronto Temperance
Society, a long long time ago, in a far away land known as Toronto.

################################################################################

SCENE 2: We find ourselves in a meeting of the Toronto Temperance Society. Ike
Nutana stands on a podium before a small crowd of fervent prohibitionists,
making an impassioned speech about a new temperance colony in the Northwest
Territories.

{ Ike is center-stage.  Eileen, Judith, Drinkle, and Dief stand stage left. }
{ Eileen is stage-right of Ike }

IKE: { Wrapping a gavel } Ladies and gentlemen, I, President Ike Nutana, call this meeting of the
Toronto { Torana } Temperance Society to order. Thank you for joining us this 
fine morning,
as we gather to depart westward, to soberly find our fortunes in the uncharted
wilderness of { epicly } Western Canada. Our train will be departing in one 
hour, at four
o'clock AM. Regrettably, it seems that one member of our flock has wandered
further astray, and may not be with us to depart this morning. { Raising his
hands to assure his flock } I don't believe a
word of it - but some say he's taken to the drink once more!

DIEF: (gasps hysterically, faints) { backwards } 

EILEEN: And good riddance! That no-good, whisky-sluggin' John Lake was tearing
this temperance society apart! { To Judith and the crowd, and then to Ike }

IKE: Oh come on, Eileen! John Lake may not have been the most *consistent* soul,
 { Preaching } but what is a temperance society for, if not to guide the lost sheep back to
decency? { Again, the flock }

{ Dief waking up here }

JUDITH: President Nutana, I must disagree. As Vice-President of this society I
have taken note { standing with her hand on her hips } of Mr. Lake's behaviour over the last nine years. He comes in
here every week stinking of gin, saying he's sworn off the drink, eats all of
our cookies and juice, and then stumbles off to the bar again!

DIEF: Mr. Lake wouldn't do that! He promised me last night that he was going to
pour out his last bottle of raspberry schnapps and was terribly excited to move
out West with us!

(enter JOHN, clearly very drunk)

JOHN: Hey everybody! Glad to see that all of you lovely, { In the crowd, past
Ike, to Eileen and Judith } beautiful people are
here so early { how early? }. Our train is leaving for Saskaschjidawin [sic: Saskatchewan]
very soon, haven't you heard? { To crowd? }

(silence, crowd stares at JOHN)

IKE: John. We weren't expecting to see you... { Sad? Worried? }

JOHN: { Only faltering momentarily } Well, I'm here now, that's for sure.
Luggage and everything. { Leaning on Ike's podium, stage right } (raises
arrangement of pots/pans/assorted crap). (squints, noticing  watch) Okay, so I guess I
might be a few minutes late... but you know how it is { How do we nuudge!?! }(nudges Ike) { A bit of a
chuckle here } I mean,
pioneering is going to be hard work, so I figure, may as well get well rested. I
just had the longest and most serenest night of sleep in my life. Guess I
overslept by a couple of winks (winks at audience).

EILEEN: { Stage left, appealing to John on his other side }
 Did you have that long night of sleep in a tub of whisky, John? Because
it darn well smells like it!

JOHN: Oh come on, Eileen! You know I live near a bar - 
maybe someone spilled a little bit of a drink on me when I was walking over here.

IKE: See Eileen? I guess we just had a little misunderstanding. { trying to
calm Eileen, but very unsure }

EILEEN: (walks past John to get in Ike's face) Ike! John Lake does not live
'near a bar', { Angry mom whispering } he lives on a goddamn farm! The nearest bar is five miles in the
opposite direction, { Getting louder } and he shouldn't even have a license to drive his wagon out
there anymore! { Quite ANGRY }

(meanwhile, behind EILEEN, JOHN is fumbling in his jacket for a flask)

IKE: Now listen Eileen, you'd better watch your language- the Lord doesn't take
kindly to using his name like that. Now, I can't rightly say why John Lake
smells so strongly { Lay into it here } like whisky, but I'll be darned if he's not a good honest
soul, so... 

DIEF: Geez, Mr. Lake looks powerful thirsty!

IKE: GODDAMIT LAKE!

(JOHN, swigging aggressively from his flask, turns to face IKE. JOHN slowly
conceals the drink again)

JOHN: Now listen...

IKE: I swear { it } John, after all this time I've spent defending your name here, I
can't believe this is the way you repay me. We're a temperance society, for
crying out loud! Do you even understand what that means? { Sounding helpless }

JOHN: Well Ike (spreads arms)... I mean, I won't pretend to be perfect. {
legitimate or insincere sadness at the prospect } buuut,
you gotta trust, once we get to Saskatchawumble, things'll be different. Just
Ike and his old friend John (nudge in the shoulder), temperancizing together.
Like old times!

IKE: John, get out.

JOHN: What's that? Ike, you can't mean that!

IKE: No, I mean it. You will not be joining this temperance colony in
Saskatchewan. Take your pots and pans and get out of here.

(JOHN turns, shocked, appealing to his audience)

JOHN: Are you guys serious? I mean, Eileen- come on! You agree with this guy?
After all we've been through?

EILEEN: 'This guy' is my husband, and if I'd had my way you would have been out
of here years ago.

JOHN: Judith? You're with me, right? { options are running out here }

JUDITH: I certainly am not!

{ Dief is not standing small with clasped hands and small shoulders } 

JOHN: (mimes a dagger being driven into his back) Whoa? that's some low-down,
dirty stuff right there. (turns and gestures to DIEF) I mean, and you had to do
it in front of this innocent child? { Using Dief as a prop again }

IKE: Listen John, I'm only going to say it once more. This poor boy is going to
be far better off without a man of your ilk planting sinful notions in his head.
In fact, I reckon the whole temperance colony will be better off without your
meddling! The West is a hard place, and you need hard work and decent sobriety
to make it - no man like you would *ever* cut it out on the Prairie!

(JOHN is silent for a moment)

JOHN: Alright, alright {...} aaaalright. I see how it is. I see how you people treat
your friends. But you know what? { quieter } { Really trying to look the underdog, here }
 (lets it hang awkwardly long) I said, YOU KNOW
WHAT?

IKE: (reluctantly) What, John?

JOHN: I think you're all going to learn a valuable lesson! I think one day
you'll look back and think, 'Geez, John Lake really was the most honest and
pioneering-est man in this whole damn society, and we were _wrong_ to treat him
like we did.' Well, I tell you what - I don't need you folks anymore, {
building passionately } I'm going
to head out West by myself, and found the sickest temperance colony Saskatchyuck
ever saw! Lake, OUT!

(JOHN turns dramatically, slams door)

DIEF: { sniffles } Geez Mr. Nutana. Do you think we'll ever see him again?

IKE: I don't rightly know son, I don't rightly know. (shakes head and glances at
watch) Well, ladies and gentlemen, we'd best be on our way to the train station.
Saskatchewan awaits!

################################################################################

SCENE 3: IKE, EILEEN, DIEF, JUDITH, and the other settlers are lined up at the
edge of the stage, waiting for their (very late) train. Their impatience is
palpable.

{ Close to stage left. Judith, Ike, and then Eileen and Dief }
 
EILEEN: { Unable to restrain herself, but happy for the attention } 
Four hours! Four hours for a train! { Showing off, to the group (Virtue
signaling) } I bet Moses and the Israelites could have crossed the whole Red 
Sea in less time than that! { To Ike for reassurance } Don't you figure?
{ That was great! } 

IKE: Come on Eileen, { Shakespearean } 'To every thing there is a season, and 
a time to every purpose under heaven.' And besides! Those Israelites had the 
Egyptians breathing down their necks! I'm sure you'd manage to get away a lot 
faster if you were running from something that terrible!

(JOHN stumbles on stage, trailed by an ensemble of drunks, BARRY and DRINKLE
included, all carrying similar collections of junk luggage. JOHN sidles up to
JUDITH, who is closest to his end of the stage)

JOHN: Judith! Old buddy! { Attempting a failed familiar greeting perhaps? } 
{ Awkwardly } It's good to see you man! I tell you what, I just hit
on a real stroke of luck. Did you know, if you buy tickets for a train that's
over four hours late, the folks at CP Rail will give 'em to you to for sixty
percent off!

{ pushing John back a little } 
DIEF: Mr. Lake! You're back! (runs up and hugs him) { Around waist } 

EILEEN: What? { Distressed } 

DIEF: Look, Mr. Nutana! Old John Lake is back!

(IKE and JOHN stare each other down)

DIEF: { Tugging John out further } Does this mean that Mr. Lake gets to come 
West with us after all?

EILEEN: Certainly not! (to JOHN)

IKE: Now listen, John { Very curt } . I don't know what you think you're doing 
here, but I told you very clearly - (cut off) { that you weren't to come back here! } 

JOHN: No! I told you, very clearibly! (slurring, still drunk!) I told you lousy
freeloaders exactly what I thought of you back at the meeting! AND, I told you
exactly what I intend to do! I'm heading West to found the most radically
temperate temperance colony in the history of Saskaranaska! { Addressing John's
flock now! } A shining beacon of virtue! A city on a hill, if they have a hill. 
And what's more, I've assembled the most virtuous, hardiest crew of pioneers 
our good Lord ever laid his gorgeous baby blue eyes on!

BARRY: (strides forward to shake IKE's hand, knocking over some luggage in his
blindness) Pleasure finally meet you, Mr. Ike! My name's Barrabus Riversdale,
though you can call me Blind Barry? If ya like (winks and chuckles). I?m awful
excited over the idea of John's new colonizin? scheme- temperance?ll do just
fine for me!

IKE: John? Where in Heaven's name did you dig up this sorry collection of
drunks? The gutter?!

JOHN: { Not to be outdone } Not all of them! I found Barry here scaling the 
walls of the Sisters of Mercy Convent down on Sullivan Street.

BARRY: There's plenty of places look the same when you're blind! (cackles)

IKE: (shocked) So John, where exactly are you planning on setting up this
crackpot colony of yours?

JOHN: Uh? what's it to you, Ike?! (too defensively) Planning on buying a house
there?

IKE: You really have no idea where you're going, do you? Did you consider this
plan for longer than five minutes?

JOHN: Pfft? listen to this guy! (appeals to all colonists) Sounds to me like
somebody might be projecting their own insecurities into this situation. 

IKE: (muttering) Yeah, I'm pretty sure it?s you, John.

JOHN: There he goes again! Where exactly are YOU planning to start YOUR
temperance colony?

JUDITH: Are you serious, John?? That?s the only thing we?ve discussed at our
meetings for the past two months? How could even you have been drunk enough to
forget that?

IKE: Well John, as you can see from both of our tickets, we're headed to the
eastern banks of the South Saskatchewan River. The end of the line. Doesn?t get
any more western than that!

JOHN: Oh? doesn't it! Because, uh, it just so happens that me and my associates
are also headed to the end of line? and beyond! The western bank of the South
Saskamazoo River! Where no men dared to tread before, I assume!

IKE: Well they rarely tread there, because it?s across a very wide river. And
there?s no bridge.

JOHN: (places hand on IKE?s shoulder) Well Ike, you know what they say: we?ll
cross that river when we, uh... at some point.

(sound of approaching train)

DIEF: Look Mr. Nutana! Our train's finally here!

BARRY: Humph! About time!

################################################################################

SCENE 4: During this scene, we follow DIEF back and forth between the two
colonies (Nutana on stage left and Saskatoon on stage right). Each time DIEF
crosses the stage he pours water over his head from the bucket labelled 'South
Saskatchewan River.' At first, IKE is standing at a podium addressing his
colonists, EILEEN by his side. The town sign reading 'Welcome to Nutana' is
covered with a white sheet, and stands behind him.

{ Judith, Ike behind the podium, and Eileen from center-stage to right }
IKE: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your courage in making this momentous
journey West! There is much work to be done, but for now I would like { to } take a
moment to decide, _together_, upon a name for our beautiful colony! Do I hear any
suggestions?

JUDITH: (hand shoots up) { Strutting out to lecture the audience } 
 As Vice-President of the Temperance Society, I was
thinking it might be nice to name the place after 'Damascus'. It's one of the
most ancient and beautiful cities in the world, and features heavily in the _Holy
Bible_. We all know that Saint Paul experienced his great revelation and
conversion to Christianity on the road to Damascus, and I thought it _might_ be
nice to think that all of the colonists who journey out here might also find
God?s salvation ?on the road to Damascus?

(The other colonists praise this suggestion enthusiastically)

IKE: (looking uncomfortable) Um, yes. That's very nice Judith. Does anyone have
any, um, other suggestions?

(silence from crowd)

JUDITH: Did you have an idea, Ike?

IKE: Well, um - I was thinking maybe we might name the town 'Nutana'. You know?
after my wife!

(EILEEN slaps IKE on the arm)

JUDITH: Aaaand after yourself of course. You are President Nutana!

EILEEN: { Well } Maybe he deserves it! Ike has done an awful lot for this society
over the past ten years! Maybe we should name the colony after him! 

(mutters of unenthusiastic agreement)

JUDITH: Why don't we put it to a vote then? 'Damascus' or 'Nutana'!

IKE: Well, you see - I did already make the sign? (sheepishly unveils
?Welcome to Nutana ? Nutana Shines!? sign.)

DIEF crosses the river. John is standing on a stool, in front of soaking wet
Saskatoon colonists.

{ Quite unsure of himself, but putting on a brave face? }
{ TODO: pacing and blocking here for John }
JOHN: Well, it was a cold swim, but here we are! { Drunk cold? } The western bank of the South
Saskissippi River, and the site of Canada's newest, hippest and hottest
temperance colony! But you know what they say: a rose without { by any other
name? } a name... could sure
use a name! So hear me out! I was thinking, lets future proof this place! Let's
think big! Five, six years down the road, this place is gonna be Canada's New
York City, and it's going to need a name to match. So I asked myself, 'John, how
did New York do it'? I'll tell you! They picked the same name as the state they
were in!

BARRY: I thought it was named after York! In England!

JOHN: (chuckles) Oh, Blind Barry. You know { LITERALLY } nothing about branding. See, New York
is called New York, because New York, New York just rolls right off the tongue!
It's irresistible! Which is why I think we should name our city after the region
we're in - you know, go for that same vibe. So, my friends - welcome: to Saskatoon,
Saskatoon! { Pretty loud energetic shouting }

DRINKLE: Shouldn't it be 'Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan'?

JOHN: (unreasonably angry) Hey! Read my lips, Drinkle! S-A-S-K-A-TOON! {
Slowing down there before failing completely }
Saskatoon, Saskatoon! Same as the province! Now go and make me a goddamn sign!

DIEF crosses the river. IKE is seated at a desk with JUDITH standing over his
shoulder.

{ Dief next to the door, right of Judith }

JUDITH: President Nutana. The colony appears to be doing well, but the new
residents are getting confused now that we have more than one road through town.
I say, its high time we added some street names. I was thinking 'Central Avenue'
for our main thoroughfare. What would you suggest? { Straight ahead still }

IKE: Well, I was thinking about that, and seeing as the colony is called
'Nutana', it might make it easier- or more familiar- for people if we called the
main street 'Nutana Street'. I mean, I'm open to suggestions, but? fewer names
to remember?

JUDITH: Well, um? it's certainly? (spots DIEF in the corner) You there, young
John! What do you think of the name 'Nutana Street'?

DIEF: Ah geez, Ms. Sutherland, well I'm just a kid! but I heard there's a lot of
talk going on in Mr. Lake's new colony across the river - they say it's going to
be the next New York City! { To Ike } And that sure sounds awful exciting! { To
the audience }

IKE: That lout John Lake thinks that his depraved cesspool is going to be the
next New York City?! { Incensed by this! } Well, we'll show him! I say we name our biggest street
'Broadway'! { To himself, and no one } That'll teach them who the real New York of Saskatchewan is!

JUDITH: Well, President. Nutana, that's a nice thought, but we are a temperance
colony. Do you really think it's proper for us to name our main street after
someplace as sinful and extravagant as Broadway? What if it encourages... theatre?

IKE: Nonsense, it'll never come to that, Judith. But { REDACTED } I suppose
you could pay tribute to our principles - how about we name those other two
streets, 'Temperance' and 'Colony'? Is that 'temperance colony' enough for you?
We'll just hit people right over the head with it!

JUDITH: (taken aback) Yes, um, well I suppose that solves our naming problem.

DIEF crosses the river. JOHN is slumped in his desk, slugging from a bottle.
DRINKLE knocks, then comes in through the door, which he leaves open for DIEF.

JOHN: (clumsily hides bottle) Dammit, Drinkle! Your mother never teach you to
knock!

DRINKLE: Sorry, Mr. Lake. But it seems like Nutana has had road names for a few
months now... and um... well, we don't. And people keep getting lost. So, I drafted
up this list of potential road names you might want to look over.

(JOHN rips the list out of DRINKLE's hands, tossing it violently offstage)

JOHN: I've had it up to here with your suggestions - Drinkle! Probably want me to
name the streets 'Drinkle 1' and 'Drinkle 2', just like your stupid { little } 
buildings, hey?

DRINKLE: Um, well, no actually. I was thinking that maybe we could name them
after important figures in Canadian history, like MacDonald, or Cartier, or
Tecumseh?

JOHN: That's a terrible idea! Why would you even think that's a good idea?
Listen Drinkle { I pity you, I really do. } - Saskatoon _is_ the next New York 
City. Hashtag Boomtown! We're future proof! No named streets, just numbers! 
Here's what we'll do - how many avenues do we have?

DRINKLE: Six.

JOHN: { Fuck you, Drinkle } Perfect! Six avenues! Here's what we're going to 
do - take the avenue furthest away from the river, and call it 1st Avenue! 
Then we'll count 1,2,3,4,5, all the way to 6th Avenue, right on the riverbank!

DRINKLE: { Obsequious, deferent to John } Uh, that might work. But what if the city expands outwards? Do we add
an Avenue Zero? { Leading John }

JOHN: Ugh, God! You're always like this! Just trust me, Drinkle! If it makes you
happy, we'll be even more future proof with the streets!

DRINKLE: What? { What does that actually mean? }

JOHN: We'll number the streets too, { Experiencing a revelation, captivated by
genius } but we'll start out with 21st Street right in the middle, and number 
them out to both sides! That way we can have even more
than 21 streets if we want to! Is there even a city on Earth with more than 21
streets!? { There 'ain't even a city on Earth with more than 21 streets! }

DRINKLE: Well, there's New York City. { If you actually want an answer...
Here's the answer: }

JOHN: Shut up, Drinkle! Get out of here and make me some road signs!

(DRINKLE leaves, BARRY walks in)

BARRY: G'day, Johnny Boy! { Sniffing? } 

JOHN: Well if it isn't Blind Barrabus Riversdale! You come to pester me about
naming streets too? { Still just angry, or a little happy to see him? }

BARRY: Well, I don't think there'll be any call for that! I wouldn't be
surprised if old Barry Riversdale got a whole neighbourhood named after him one
day!

JOHN: That'd sure be a sight! { Joking meanly }

BARRY: I just came to tell ya, { A nasty secret, this is! } that folks is 
spreading a lot of foul rumours about the colony! By the sounds of it, 
some { ironic } undesirables have been sneaking
across the river at night to buy bootlegged liquor at Nutana's train station!
'Course, you and I, upstanding citizens, wouldn't know anything about that!
(chuckles, then both he and JOHN turn away from each other and drink from hidden
bottles) I just thought you might want to be on the lookout for those darned
sneaky alcee-holics!

JOHN: I appreciate the tip Barry - anticipate a full crackdown! (slams hand on
desk, upsetting his bottle) Oh no!

DIEF sneaks across the river. IKE sits at desk, with EILEEN over his shoulder.

EILEEN: Now, I'm not one to complain Ike, but things have gotten tough this
first year out on the colony! I sure do miss our life in Toronto sometimes.

IKE: Well, Eileen, it certainly is different. Nutana might be our little piece
of heaven, but I suppose there?s a few things to be said for the big city.

EILEEN: Like a working public transportation system! Toronto?s was so nice, even
last year in 1904 it was so easy to get around without a vehicle!

IKE: Well, that sort of thing comes with time. So long as I?m in charge, we
should be able to invest in something like that in a few year?s.

EILEEN: Well I certainly hope so! Can you imagine if we just forgot to invest
early-on in a viable transit system, and completely neglected our transportation
infrastructure? Good luck being New York City then!

IKE: Well, I suppose that's true.

EILEEN: And remember how we always used to go see the Maple Leafs play on the
weekend back in Toronto? How long do you think it?ll be before we get a
professional sports team of our own?

IKE: Well, I suppose that?ll come after the transit?s dealt with. I mean, where
else would they go? Regina!? (laughs)

EILEEN: Ugh, it?s just so frustrating! I wish our little colony could afford
those things now!

(enter JUDITH) { Stage right-ish }

JUDITH: Pardon me, President Nutana, Mrs. Nutana. I have an important idea that
must be discussed.

IKE: Oh hey Judith, well, let?s hear it!

JUDITH: Very well. So, we all know how John Lake and his disciples have been
crossing the river every night, and sneaking down to our railyard to buy
bootlegged liquor from the hobos. { Contempt }

{ Eileen coming to Ike's side }

EILEEN: Of course! Everyone knows, they aren't terribly secretive about it.

JUDITH: Well, as Vice-President of this temperance colony, I was thinking, with
all of that black market commerce going around, we may as well crack down and
put a tax on it! { Excitedly, pause for a half-second longer } I was running some calculations, and it seems to me that we
could pull in a _substantial_ amount of revenue for the colony.

IKE: Judith, we?re a temperance colony! What kind of message would it send if we
involved ourselves in the sale of alcohol?! I won?t have it!

JUDITH: Well, it would just be a tax. We wouldn't be *officially* endorsing the
sale, and I highly doubt anyone but Mr. Lake's followers would be buying
anything.

EILEEN: How much money did you say this would be bringing in again?

(JUDITH lays out papers on IKE?s desk)

IKE: My God!

EILEEN: Is that enough for a transit system, Ike?

IKE: That's enough for ten transit systems! Eileen, give us a moment - Judith
and I need to discuss some tax policy...

(DIEF is sneaking back to Saskatoon, BARRY stops him by placing a hand on his
shoulder.)

{ Dief peeking over her shoulder to make sure no one has seen him follow }
{ Coming up from behind and stage right of Dief, somehow being sneaky }

BARRY: Now, where you do you think you're going, Young John?!

{ Barry stage-right of Dief }

DIEF: Gosh! Mr. Riversdale! How did you see me? Or know who I was? Are your eyes
feeling better?

BARRY: Nope! Still blind as a bat! But I think you'll find that old Blind Barry
sees more than most!

DIEF: Gosh!

{ Come up to Dief to relay a secret! }
BARRY: Now, have you been sneakin across that river to bootleg liquor again?!
That's awful dangerous stuff you know!

DIEF: Geez Mr. Riversdale, no way! I don't drink, I'm just a kid! I just like to
come over to visit Mr. Lake from time to time. I sure do miss him over in
Nutana! { Jumping around }

BARRY: Oh, a likely story! { Coming across Dief to get inbetween her and the
river } Now, I don't want to see you swimming in that river
again - not that I could see ya - so here! Have a sip of Barry's whisky {
hwhis-key } and be on your way!

DIEF: Are you sure?

BARRY: Sure as shootin! { Shooting, yes } (DIEF drinks) Distilled that batch myself in my old
bathtub - haven't bathed in weeks!

DIEF: (spits) Wow, that sure is powerful stuff!

BARRY: (chuckles) Alright, you run along now! Make sure you get across that
river safe! They haven't built any of the bridges yet!

DIEF: What bridges, Mr. Riversdale?

BARRY: Well, old Blind Barry gets a hunch every so often, and most of them turn
out true! And just this morning, I was swimming across that river - never you
mind why! { Prophecy here, coming down center-stage } and I had a hunch that one 
day they'd build so many bridges across
it, they'd come to call Saskatoon 'The City of Bridges'!

DIEF: Gosh, that sure would be strange! { Coming down-stage next to Barry to
protest } I mean, so many other cities have lots
of bridges, it really wouldn't make us any different than most other places!
Don't you reckon there'll be anything better happening in Saskatoon worth
advertising?

BARRY: (chuckles) Well, I suppose we'll just have to see about that!

DIEF crosses the river. EILEEN and JUDITH stand behind IKE, who is seated at his
desk, looking defeated.

IKE: For the last time, I won't have it! We are not building a bar in our
temperance colony!

JUDITH: President Nutana, consider that { this isn't going to be... }

IKE: No! I won't hear { have } it! I don't care how much money the liquor tax is bringing
in! And yes, I know, it's a lot of money! I don't care that it's only the {
pause } damned
drunks from Saskatoon who are buying the liquor! We are a temperance colony!
Temperance colonies do not operate bars! Not even John Lake's so-called
temperance colony has gone that far!

EILEEN: { Feminine charm } Ike, I know what Judith is saying sounds a little backwards. But you
should hear her out. Look at all the good the liquor tax has done already! We're
well on our way to having an affordable and accessible transit system. Just
imagine the good we could do if we sold the liquor directly instead of just
taxing it!

IKE: Eileen! Are you listening to yourself? We are a temperance colony! Does
no-one understand that?

EILEEN: Do you understand it, Ike? Judith and I are trying to keep this colony
on its feet! If we can't keep up with the basics of a growing city, our people
will start to move away to better, flashier options, like Regina!

IKE: Come on Eileen. Nobody would ever willingly move to Regina. And besides,
even without the bar, our streets are flooded with those Saskatoon drunks every
night - it would only get worse! { And the worst part is, } they're sopping wet! Do
you know they swim across the river every time they're looking for a drink?

JUDITH: Well, there may be a solution to that problem. As Vice-President, I took
the initiative to draw up some schematics, and I think it might be feasible for
us to build a bridge between Nutana and Saskatoon that would enable the drunks
to get across the river, quick and { preppy funny dry } dry.

IKE: A bridge?! And how exactly do you propose we afford a bridge?!

JUDITH: Well, here are the projected profits for the first two months of the
bar's operation.

IKE: My God. { Sells himself out }

DIEF crosses the river. BARRY walks in the door to find JOHN slumped over desk,
drinking again. JOHN chokes in surprise and hides the liquor.

{ Barry entering from up-stage right, around through the door }

BARRY: (Shouting) Mr. Lake! Are you in here?

JOHN: { Startled } Yes! I'm here! And geez Barry, what'd I tell you about yelling for me
every time you enter the room?

BARRY: You said not to do it, Mr. Lake. But some say you can't teach an old dog
new tricks! Especially a blind dog!

JOHN: I suppose that's true. So, what brings you around at this ungodly hour?

BARRY: Well, you know I wouldn't normally come barging in at two { o'clock } in the
afternoon, { To audience }  but there's been some awful commotion down by the river! Looks to me
like Ike Nutana and his namby-pamby teetotalers is building themselves a bridge!

{ Quite interested in this news, getting out of his desk }

JOHN: Blind Barry, you're saying you _saw_ them building a bridge?

{ To John }
BARRY: Course not! I'm blind as sin! But I could feel it in my bones!

JOHN: Well that's certainly interesting news. When do you figure they'll be done
building it?

BARRY: Well, if my trick knee's telling me right, I reckon they'll be done
around two weeks from tomorrow. Pending construction delays, of course.

JOHN: Well, your trick knee's steered us wrong before, Barry. I say, we better
keep a real close eye on those Nutanians! I reckon they might be trying to ford
the river so they can launch an attack on our freedoms! And heaven knows that
once that bridge is open they'll be free to sell their devilish liqueurs to our
poor citizens at an even faster rate! It's an epidemic! (drinks)

BARRY: I'll drink to that! (drinks) What do you reckon we should do if they
finish it?

JOHN: Well Barry, if it comes to that, { Grim: "We'll be ready..." } I want the two of us to be the first ones
on the scene. { With grandeur } We'll figure out what that sneak Nutana is up to, even if it means
crossing that river, { -> losing face here } for the first time since we arrived! 

(JOHN and BARRY cheers each other and drink)

################################################################################

SCENE 5: IKE, EILEEN, JUDITH, DIEF, and the Nutana colonists are standing in
front of a sign reading ?Victoria Bar?. JUDITH stands at the podium. JOHN,
BARRY, and DRINKLE enter from stage left.

JUDITH: { Looking to individual audience members }
Ladies and gentlemen! As Vice-President of the Society, I am pleased to
welcome you to the grand opening of the Nutana Temperance Colony?s first
drinking establishment! This is an historic day! Never before has a temperance
colony thought to open a bar within their own confines, and I assure you that
this decision will show the great resolve of the Nutana people to resist the
evils of alcohol, and bring tremendous profits to our city coffers. I officially
dedicate this bar to Canada's beloved monarch, Queen Victoria, in celebration of
her Platinum Jubilee! As well, some of you may have arrived today on the newly
completed Victoria Bridge, { obvious naming choice is obvious } 
which we named after the bar. I encourage you to make
full use of our new facility, and to always bear in mind the strict values of
our temperance colony. God bless us all! I now declare the Victoria Bar
officially open!

(applause from crowd)

(JOHN walks over to IKE)

JOHN: So, Ike. Looks like things are really picking up over here. Believe it or
not, my temperance colony doesn't even have a bar yet!

IKE: John Lake, you pretentious lout! Everyone knows we only sell liquor to your
residents- the tax revenue from you and Blind Barry alone paid for our new
streetcar system!

JOHN: Well, at least we came by that money honestly! Not by selling the devil?s
wares!

EILEEN: John. It's three in the afternoon, you run a temperance colony, and
you're positively reeking of gin. Ike is not interested in listening to you
moralize.

DRINKLE: Hey there! Don?t you go slandering Mr. Lake?s name like that!

JOHN: Shut up, Drinkle! This doesn?t involve you! Now listen! Ike, Eileen, this
guy -

JUDITH: It's me, Judith Sutherland. From the Temperance Society. We've known
each other for ten years!

JOHN: And it only took you about five minutes to stab me in the back though,
hey? Anyways, you people have fun at your bar! I'll be returning home to my
liquor-free colony, and might be I won?t even come back here too often! Once a
week at most, certainly, assuming you have an offsale. Good day!

(JOHN and DRINKLE begin to leave. BARRY approaches IKE.)

BARRY: You know Mr. Nutanner, I just thought I ought to warn ya. See, I have a
knack for knowin? what?s gonna happen to folks, and I just had the most peculiar
suspicion that your bar there, and that there bridge, might bring about a series
of events that result in your tragic and untimely death by bullet-wound!

EILEEN: Well, I never!

IKE: Is that a threat, sir?!

BARRY: Nope! Just one of my crazy hunches!

(BARRY turns away, but DIEF tugs on his sleeve)

DIEF: Mr. Riversdale! Is Mr. Nutana gonna be alright? Can you really predict the
future?

BARRY: Well, some says old Blind Barry sees more than most! Alls I know is, a
nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse! (chuckles) Giddy up!

################################################################################

SCENE 6: IKE and WILF sit at desks on opposite sides of the stage. Both are
writing letters, and narrating as they write.

IKE: Dear Prime Minister Laurier. May I call you Wilf? You will not have heard
of me before, but I am one of the hardy pioneers who has founded a settlement
out West. Nutana is the pride of the Saskatchewan region, and is fast growing
into an exciting and moral metropolis. I have heard great things about your
plans to incorporate Saskatchewan as a province. I believe that Nutana would be
an ideal capital city. If you find yourself in the West I certainly hope you
would accept our hospitality, and learn about what makes Nutana shine! 

Sincerely, Mayor Ike Nutana.

WILF: Dear Mayor Nutana. Perhaps 'Wilf' is a little too informal. As it happens,
I will be traveling to Saskatchewan in two week's time to celebrate its
incorporation as a province. { Pause here to contemplate the profundify of the
following phrase. } These are important times! New provinces! Women's
suffrage! I mean, it's 1915! (spreads arms in a Trudeau-esque fashion)
{ Try quickly and matter-of-fact-ly } Unfortunately, we have already decided 
upon your neighbour Regina as the capital, but hey, it wasn't my idea. Perhaps 
we can find you a nice university or something. I look forward to meeting you. 
Sunny ways! Wilfred Laurier.

IKE: Dear Wilfred. This is fantastic news. I've found a spot of land next to the
river that is just begging for a university to be built on it. I would recommend
bringing with you a very large, engraved cornerstone with which we can begin
construction. We will make a whole afternoon of it. My wife Eileen will do up
some baking. Best wishes, Mayor Ike Nutana. P.S. I have been to Regina and I do
 { I. Have. Been. To... } not think you should make it the capital. Have you 
seen it before?

WILF: { Thinking of what how to respond to this weirdo. } Greetings, Mayor 
Nutana. If it's not too much trouble, 'Wilfred' is still
a touch too informal. I am the Prime Minister, I suppose. I don't entirely
understand your preoccupation with this large cornerstone, but rest assured I
will set one of my less useful cabinet ministers around to making one. I will be
departing West shortly- do you have any important advice on how to locate your
colony? Sunny Ways! Prime Minister Laurier.

IKE: Wilfy, old boy! Great to hear from you! Nutana is very easy to locate. It's
just at the end of the current railway line, right on the river bank, next to
the lovely new bridge. Please be advised that on the opposite side of the river
is a colony named Saskatoon, which is a despicable backwater teeming with
undesirable characters. You should have no difficulty distinguishing between our
colonies, as their so-called temperance colony is overflowing with unwashed
drunks. Safe travels! Your buddy, Ike.

################################################################################

SCENE 7: WILF arrives in Nutana outside the Victoria Bar. BARRY is sitting
beside the door { in a chair }, very drunk and nursing a bottle.

{ Enter from Stage left - Peek around the scene, notice Barry - turn to
audience, and proceed } 
WILF: Excuse me sir! I've just gotten off of my train- somehow we seem to have
arrived four hours early! I was wondering if you could point me in the right
direction?

BARRY: (chuckles) { Still sitting } Well, I suppose that all depends on what you're trying to
find! The bar's right here, mister!

WILF: Ah, I see. I was warned about this area.  { Looking concerned } I'm 
looking for the temperance
colony, which should be just across the river. I'm to have a meeting with their
mayor.

BARRY: You don't say?! { Getting up here } Why, it so happens that I'm a close 
personal friend of the mayor! You just stick with me, and old Blind Barry will show you the way!

WILF: Oh, well that's very... thoughtful of you. Are you sure you'll be able to
um... see the way, Blind Barry?

BARRY: Well, I may be blind, but I've got a keen sense of direction!

(BARRY and WILF walk across the river to Saskatoon, and knock on JOHN's door.)

JOHN: What now?!

BARRY: We've got visitors here, Mr. Mayor! Someone who wants to meet you?

JOHN: Who is it?!

BARRY: I can't say for certain, but he's dressed awful expensive, and he smells
like a real gentleman! Could be some kind of movie star or automobile salesman!

JOHN: (walks outside) Well, you weren't lying. So then, what's the big idea,
slick? Looking to buy some kind of business deal? { Let expression drop } 
You're probably here to talk
to Drinkle, aren't you? You two can have a nice drink together and laugh about
how goddamn rich you are!. DRINKLE! Get over here! One of your hoity-toity
friends from finishing school is here to see you!

(DRINKLE rushes out.)

DRINKLE: Mr. Lake! Barry! Mr. - oh? oh my! Mr. Prime Minister! It's an honour,
sir! What are you doing so far West??

WILF: Oh, hello! Well, I'm sorry to have... surprised you. I'm here touring
Western Canada, before Saskatchewan is incorporated as a province. I've been
corresponding with the mayor of your town for several months now, and the place
looks just as lovely as he described. 

DRINKLE: Oh, it's so kind of you to say so! Why don't you leave your bags inside
the house here, and we can show you around town!

WILF: Oh, why thank you! (goes inside house)

DRINKLE: Mr. Lake! What was that all about?! You've been exchanging letters with
the Prime Minister? This is enormous! Why didn't you tell us he was coming?

JOHN: Well, you know how it goes. I mean, I didn't think much of it at the time-
he's really just another friend to me. And to tell you the truth, I'd nearly
forgotten about sending all those letters.

DRINKLE: Mr. Lake. You didn't send any letters, did you?

JOHN: Well, uh' not that I can recall. But he's here, isn't he?! I must have
sent them at some point!

BARRY: The postal system works in mysterious ways, boy!

DRINKLE: Oh my? I think I've { I was a real perceptive fellow in my younger
days dontcha know } figured out what's going on here. Unless I'm
mistaken, I think Ike Nutana sent those letters- and the Prime Minister is lost!

JOHN: And you're sure that's the Prime Minister? Of Canada?

DRINKLE: Yes, Mr. Lake. Don't you know what the Prime Minister looks like? He
has such great hair!

JOHN: Shut up Drinkle, you're wasting time! We've landed the big one here! Fell
right into our laps, but you know what? We've got to put that good old Saskatoon
ingenuity to work here, and really _wring_ this guy for all he's worth!

DRINKLE: Mr. Lake! You're talking about the Prime Minister!

JOHN: I know that, Drinkle! That's been established! Think of the good this
could do for our community! This could be our New York moment! This could put
Saskatoon, Saskatoon on the map! 

BARRY: Hot diggity!

(WILF walks back outside, with his shirt entirely open and unbuttoned, which
seems to shock him)

WILF: Oh, whoops! This keeps happening! (buttons up shirt)

JOHN: Mr. Prime Minister! Good to have you back! Now, my associate informs me
that there's been a little tiny bit of a mix-up here. You might have wound up in
the right town, completely on accident. See, this lovely, pristine temperance
colony you see before you is none other than Saskatoon! And I have the pleasure
of being its mayor, John Lake! (they shake hands) And these are Barrabus
Riversdale and John Drinkle, two of Saskatoon's most upstanding citizens!

WILF: Oh! Well, it's certainly a pleasure to make your acquaintance, but you
see, I actually arrived to meet with a Mr. Ike Nutana.

JOHN: Ike Nutana! That drunk?! That con artist?! What could possibly possess you
to want to visit a no-good thieving lowlife like Ike Nutana?

WILF: Well, I have to say I'm shocked! I had heard only glowing reviews of Mr.
Nutana's character, and of his little temperance colony.

JOHN: From his own lying mouth, I'll bet! Answer me one question, Wilf- how many
temperance colonies do you know of with a thriving bar scene? 

WILF: That's a fair point. You might not believe this, but Mr. Nutana assured me
that it was Saskatoon that had the drinking problem. But from a quick glance
it's easy to see that he got that quite backwards! You wouldn't believe the
number of drunks I ran into, { <- funny! } just strolling down their so-called 
Temperance Street!

BARRY: Disgraceful!

JOHN: So, Mr. Wilfrid. It looks like we've got ourselves into a real dilly of a
pickle. That miserable pig-stealer Nutana got you ride the train all the way
down here, only to find out that his temperance colony is a colony of lies! But,
you know, every chocolate bar has a silver lining. Lucky for you, you?ve
wandered into the future New York City of Canada- good old Saskatoon, Saskatoon!
I figure, so long as you?re making up new provinces, this little old colony
might make a good capital!

WILF: Well, that's certainly a thought. Unfortunately, Ottawa has already
decided to place the capital in Regina.

JOHN: Regina?! Have you even been there? It's like a strip-mall that never ends!
and the name { - it } just sounds lewd! You want to put that on maps? 
In our children's classrooms?

WILF: Sorry John, that definitely was not my call to make. I'll tell you what
though. When Ike Nutana and I were talking, he was hoping that Nutana could be
the home of Saskatchewan's first university. Considering our situation, perhaps
Saskatoon would be a better location for our seat of higher learning.

BARRY: You're darn tootin, Wilfie boy { Come up with different but equally
informal name } ! I think you'll find that Saskatoon has a
rich intellectual community. And ain't nobody reads more books around here than
old Blind Barry!

JOHN: It's true, Mr. Prime Minister. And we'd be super-duper honoured to start
up your university here.

WILF: Perfect. Now, this may seem strange, but when I offered Mr. Nutana the
university he was very adamant that I bring him an engraved cornerstone to
commemorate the occasion. This thing must weigh two tons or more, and I've had
to haul it all the way here from Ottawa. It's still sitting in the railyard.
Would you mind putting it to use when you begin construction?

JOHN: A two-ton, engraved cornerstone? God, Nutana is such a loser. Yeah sure,
we'll make sure to pick up that rock for you. In the meantime, let me give you a
tour around town. 

(DIEF runs into WILF)

DIEF: Oh, sorry sir! I was just delivering these- um, newspapers. I didn't see
you there!

WILF: Oh, no worries young man! Sunny ways! It's good to see young people like
you, out doing good, honest work. { <- Joke! }

DIEF: Geez, thanks mister!

DRINKLE: Young John, did you know the man you're speaking to is the Prime
Minister of Canada?

DIEF: Golly! No way! That sounds like an awful big job!

WILF: Oh, it certainly is. Perhaps a bit more than being a paperboy, but I
started out just the same as you.

DIEF: Really? Do you think I could be Prime Minister one day too? I'm just a
kid!

WILF: If you put your mind to it, I'm sure you could do anything you'd like.

DIEF: Wowzers! Thanks Mr. Laurier! I suppose I really should get back to work
then!

WILF: Certainly! Mr. Lake, how about that tour? (JOHN and WILF walk offstage)

BARRY: Alright now sonny, where's that liquor I had you smuggle for me?

DIEF: Right here, Mr. Riversdale! (pulls out bottle from under newspapers)

BARRY: There's a good boy!

DIEF: Mr. Riversdale, you sure know a lot about the future. Do you think it's
true what Mr. Laurier said? Could I be Prime Minister someday?

BARRY: Well, I don?t see why not, Young John! But then again, I don?t see much!

DIEF: Golly! (skips away happily)

BARRY: (turns to audience) Now, I wouldn't be surprised if that young John
Diefenbaker wound up being Prime Minister after all!

(The sound of a loon call, and an announcer voice offstage: 'A proud part of our
Canadian Heritage')

################################################################################

SCENE 8: IKE is standing in front of the Victoria Bar with JUDITH and EILEEN.  

{ Ike, Eileen, Judith from stage right to left, in front of the bar sign }

IKE: Well, that was a fine mess! { Indignant about his offended righteousness } 

JUDITH: At least now we have the cornerstone back!

IKE: I don't care about the damned cornerstone, Judith! I want to know how Lake
got the thing in the first place! How does the Prime Minister of Canada
stroll down the main street of our town, gorgeous hair and all, carrying a
two-ton stone, without a single person noticing? And who the 
hell took him over to Saskatoon?

EILEEN: Ike, honey! Language like that won't help anything.

(JOHN walks across bridge)

{ Immediately stage right of Ike } 

JOHN: What, cursing again, Nutana? { Trying to lean on Ike, but Ike gets
disgusted as soon as he notices the proximity. } 
Not so surprising, I say! I guess there really is no honour among thieves!
{ With his back to Ike, off to stage right. }

IKE: { Walking over to stage left, across from John } 
Thieves?! How dare you, Lake! The Prime Minister of Canada was supposed to
arrive here yesterday, with an engraved cornerstone for Nutana's Provincial
University. And here I come to find that the Prime Minister was turned away, 
{ approaching center-stage } and your cronies have stolen the cornerstone!

{ Pacing and orating to himself and the audience } 

JOHN: Stolen it? I'll have you know that my close personal friend, Wilfrid-
that's Prime Minister Laurier to you { Straight to Ike } 
- gave me that big ugly rock as a gift. For
Saskatoon's university! We set it down right outside my bedroom window. But I
tell ya what! { Over stage right, looking out an imaginary window } 
I wake up this morning, bright and early, take a look out the
window - and the rock's gone! So I start thinking to myself - Who in the world
would care enough about some big stupid rock, enough to haul the darn thing away
in the middle of the night?'. And then I think, 'Oh. Obviously Ike Nutana.
Literally only Ike Nutana would do that.' So, who's the thief now, thief?!

IKE: The nerve! I won't stand to hear it, John! You had best remove yourself
from my town, if you know what's good for you!

{ Face to face here for this confrontation }
JOHN: Why don't you make me! I want my rock, Ike! { Full stops: I. Want. My...
}

{ Coming between them again }

EILEEN: John! Ike! Stop acting like children! This has all become too much. If
you have a problem, resolve it like gentlemen!

JUDITH: Well said, Eileen. Historically, if a man felt that another man had
insulted his honour... 

{ To Judith }

IKE: Well, my honour has certainly been insulted!

JOHN: What honour?! { With jowls shaking! }

EILEEN: John!

JUDITH: As I was saying, if they felt their honour had been insulted, the
gentlemanly tradition was to demand satisfaction by way of a duel.

JOHN: Like, with guns? { Excited like a boy }

{ Trying to backtrack here }

JUDITH: Most often. But sometimes with swords or other weapons.

JOHN: That's unreal!

JUDITH: I suppose. But of course, that would be deeply illegal nowadays. And
with a silly issue like this, you would never want it to come to vi- { violence
}

{ Pondering this while Judith and John discuss dueling ]

IKE: John Lake, I challenge you to a duel, tonight at sundown. 

EILEEN: Ike! What are you doing?!

JOHN: I accept! Pistols at dawn!

IKE: I said at sundown, John.

JOHN: Fine! Pistols at sundown! On the Victoria Bridge. To the death!

{ Plaintive and physical with Ike - mostly to Ike }

EILEEN: This is ridiculous! What is this going to solve?

IKE: It'll solve a lot of things, { Distant } Eileen. One major problem,
{ To John } in particular. My second will be Judith Sutherland. 
Who will back you, John?

JOHN: My second will be { ... } 
Blind Barrabus Riversdale! { Pause here for effect }

{ Trying to speak reason into John, but not very affectionately }

EILEEN: John! You're a staggering drunk! You want your second for the duel to be
an elderly blind man? Stop and think for a moment! There are better ways!

JOHN: There's no better shot in Western Canada than old blind Barry, and I won't
hear you criticise him like that.

IKE: Then it's decided. Pistols at sundown.

JOHN: Aaaaaand- the winner gets to be the mayor of the dead guy's colony.

IKE: Deal.

(they shake hands, John sealing it with spit, and JOHN departs)

################################################################################

SCENE 9: JOHN, BARRY, and DRINKLE stand on one side of the bridge, with IKE,
EILEEN, DIEF and JUDITH on the other. JUDITH and BARRY walk to the centre of the
bridge.

JUDITH: Good evening, Mr. Riversdale. (they shake hands) { Struggle to find his
hand } { Barrabus counters to downstage } Traditionally, the seconds in an 
armed duel will meet beforehand to 
attempt to defuse the situation. In fact, most duels are settled this way, 
and do not actually come to
violence. I think we can both agree that this issue with the cornerstone is
trivial, and we two can resolve this as sensible people without any of this
foolishness. { No exclamation }

BARRY: Well, I suppose you can lead a horse to water, but you can't lead a mule!
(chuckles) See, I'm under strict instruction from Mr. Lake to make no compromise
whatsoever! On any terms! { Judith's face here is a little horrified }

JUDITH: { Not so frightened, Panicking } Even if we conceded the university, 
and gave you back the cornerstone?

BARRY: { Hmm... } Nope! Mr. Lake's got himself awful excited about this whole duel
business, and he'd quite like to be mayor of Mr. Nutana's colony. See, Blind
Barry is a peaceful soul, and if we had my way I figure we'd call this thing off
and talk things over! But, if I'm anything other than peaceful, I'm loyal! And
blind! { Judith here is having her optimism fall away to determined }

JUDITH: { Resigned, turned away } That is unfortunate. { turn back } o
Are you still prepared to act as Mr. Lake's second, should he be indisposed?

BARRY: Ready as a fox!

JUDITH: Fine. Then the duel will go ahead. (they shake hands and return to their
sides of the bridge)

DRINKLE: (in stage right spotlight) Alright John. Are you feeling ready for
this?

JOHN: (finishes bottle of whisky) Ready as I?ll never be! I must have read the
manual for this gun over a dozen times today, I figure I'll be able to shoot it
like a real pro!

DRINKLE: Wait, so have you shot it yet? It?s always a good idea to get a feel
for a firearm before you use it in earnest.

JOHN: What the hell do you know about guns, Drinkle? I?ve never shot a firearm
in my life- not once! Know what that means? It means my beginner?s luck is
perfectly intact. I?ll nail that sucker on my first shot!

EILEEN: (under stage left spotlight) Ike. I?m begging you. Please don?t go
through with this. I couldn?t bear to live without you.

IKE: Oh come on, Eileen. I'm going to be duelling an incoherent drunk who can
barely hold a rifle straight, being propped up by a blind man. We?ll sort out
this business with Lake, and get this whole colony back on track.

DIEF: Mr. Nutana, are you and Mr. Lake going to be okay?

IKE: I can?t rightly say, John. Eileen, cover his eyes when it happens.

(IKE and EILEEN embrace, and then IKE and JOHN walk to the centre of the bridge)

IKE: John.

JOHN: Ike.

IKE: 10 paces, counted aloud. Turn and fire on 10.

JOHN: Winner gets the colonies.

(they shake hands, and turn back to back)

IKE: (beginning to pace) 1, 2? (firearm goes off, and JOHN drops to his knees,
clutching his foot)

JOHN: Damn it! My foot! I shot my foot! Oh god, it really hurts!

IKE: John, you damned fool, what are you doing? Get up and fight!

JOHN: I can't! I'm shot!

EILEEN: Does that mean the duel is over?

JOHN: No! That's why we have seconds, Eileen! Pay attention! Blind Barry will
have to fight Ike instead!

IKE: What?!

BARRY: I'll do it!

JOHN: Drinkle! Make yourself useful and drag me out! (DRINKLE hurries over, and
awkwardly drags JOHN off the bridge. BARRY walks up to IKE.)

{ Strange motivation }

BARRY: Now listen, Mr. Nutanner! I'm not a man of violence, but I'm awfully
loyal to my old friend John over there. And there's those who say I'm the
sharpest shot this side of the St. Lawrence! I've got a nasty feeling in my old
trick knee tonight, and I expect { reckon' } you're about to die a nasty 
death by gunshot! On this very bridge. Now, if I was you, I'd take heed of Old 
Blind Barry, and scoot!

IKE: Listen, Barry. I'm not interested in your strange prophecies. But I'm also
not interested in killing you tonight, in what would be a very unfair fight. The
duel is off. I'm going home.

JOHN: See that guys! Ike Nutana is such a yellow-bellied coward, that he's
scared to face an old, blind man in a gunfight! Chicken!

IKE: John?

JOHN: (chicken noises)

JUDITH: Well Ike, you did make an agreement?

IKE: Fine! I'll do it. 10 paces, Mr. Riversdale.

(they line up back to back, and then walk ten paces, counted aloud. On ten, they
both turn, and fire simultaneously. IKE drops to the ground, clutching his
chest.)

EILEEN: Ike! (everyone runs onto bridge, JOHN stumbling behind on his bad foot)

BARRY: Did I hit him?!

JOHN: You sure did, you blind son of a gun!

JUDITH: President Nutana! You're bleeding heavily! This doesn't look good!! 

IKE: It doesn't feel too good either, Judith. I think I'm going to die on this
bridge, just like Blind Barry predicted.

JUDITH: (holding out three fingers) Don?t say that! How many fingers am I
holding up? More importantly, do you remember Clause 3 of the Temperance Society
Act, where the Vice-President assumes complete authority in the event of?

IKE: I can't tell Judith. My vision's really starting to go. I know I'm
hallucinating, but it looks like one half of this Victoria bridge is covered
with electric lights?

DRINKLE: Just one half?

IKE: Yes, I know it?s stupid, but it?s just a hallucination. No one would ever
actually put lights up on just one side of the bridge.

BARRY: I suppose we'll see about that!

IKE: Don't worry about that now. John Lake! I don?t know how you did it, but you
finally bested me. The colony of Nutana is in your hands now, and I expect that
now that our two towns are united, they?ll grow up to be the greatest city in
Saskatchewan. I want you to promise me one thing, before I die, John. One final
request.

JOHN: Anything, Ike.

IKE: Finish my work with the new transit system. Give our new city the greatest
transportation network the country has ever seen. Judith Sutherland will be here
to help you. I know he always wanted to be mayor himself, but I mean, what?s he
going to do now? Start ?Sutherland City?, and completely screw over all the work
we?ve accomplished? Nonsense! Work together and build that transit system!

JOHN: For sure Ike, I?ll get right on that.

IKE: You?d better. This is my dying wish, John. If you don?t get that transit
system running reliably, I swear to god I?ll come back from beyond the grave and
lay a curse on this city. 

JOHN: A curse?!

IKE: Yes, a curse! Road construction, on every road, forever! Even one?s that
aren?t built yet! They?ll fall apart in days and take years to fix!

JOHN: Man, that sounds nasty. 

IKE: Also, Eileen. I love you. (dies)

JOHN: Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are. Gathered to mourn the passing of
a great man- though he was a thief and a drunkard- but still great? Ike Nutana.
But, as much as we mourn his death, we should also find great joy in the
potential which it opens up for our new city. Which is now just called
Saskatoon, even the part that used to be Nutana. And I'm going to be the mayor
of all of it now, like Ike said. We've got a bright future ahead of us, no
longer held back by the shackles of petty conflicts, or by big dumb rocks. We'll
have a thriving university culture and be the envy of all the places that wish
they were us! At this big, big moment in our city's history, I'm reminded of the
words of a great man 'Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do
that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. And no can drive out of
Saskatoon, cause it's great place to live.' (polite applause from residents)

SCENE 10: BARRY is seated in his rocking chair again, with whisky and a blanket,
speaking directly to the audience.

BARRY: Well, how do you like that? That's the whole story, as best as I can
recall it. And some fine acting, if I do say so myself! Now, old Judith
Sutherland did end up starting her own city, with a sensibly named
Central Avenue and { ooh! } a very successful Sutherland Bar - unfortunately,
she also died a painful death death of typhoid fever! But John Lake went on to 
do a fine job { John Lake, though } went on to do ... of the city's transit 
system, all by himself! 'Course, even he's passed on now. Ninety years ago already, they say! { Now it's just ... } And it's just Blind Barry left to tell the
story. So you go {! - } and tell your school teachers you know the _real_ truth 
now, from someone who seen it! And if they argue with you, you just send 'em 
down here and old Barry will straighten them out himself { Possibly get dark 
and threatening there at the end }! { Happy go lucky again } Tickets are 
$12.50 apiece, { Nice and slow here } and I'll be here all week! (chuckles and 
drinks)
